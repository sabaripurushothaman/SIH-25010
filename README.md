## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
To address the persistent challenges faced by smallholder farmers in India—ranging from inefficient crop selection to indiscriminate agrochemical use—a phytoinformatics-driven, climatologically adaptive decision support system named AgriSage™ is proposed. This platform integrates soil chemometrics, remote sensing-derived vegetative indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI), and agro-meteorological data models (including Growing Degree Days and Evapotranspiration rates) to deliver real-time, hyperlocal agri-advisory services. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, Bayesian inference, and fuzzy logic, AgriSage™ generates context-aware, crop-specific recommendations that align with the farmer’s edaphic profile, phenological crop stage, and prevailing abiotic stressors.AgriSage™ also incorporates Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) protocols, geo-tagged field data, plant stress spectral signatures, and predictive yield modeling, enabling precision agriculture at the grassroots level. By optimizing fertilizer and water use, recommending climate-adaptive crop rotations, and reducing unnecessary agrochemical applications, the system enhances nutrient-use efficiency, improves yield predictability, and minimizes ecological degradation. Additionally, the platform integrates market intelligence, government policy updates, and crop insurance advisories to support economic resilience among farmers. The system operates through a multilingual, voice-enabled interface optimized for low-bandwidth rural environments, ensuring accessibility regardless of digital literacy. By incorporating Integrated Pest and Disease Management (IPDM) protocols, geo-tagged field data, and plant stress spectral signatures, the platform enables precision agriculture at the grassroots level. This not only enhances nutrient-use efficiency and yield predictability but also mitigates ecological degradation by reducing input overuse, thereby fostering sustainable, climate-resilient agroecosystems.

## Technical Approach
The proposed AgriSage™ platform will be implemented using a robust blend of advanced technologies and scientific methodologies to deliver precision agri-advisory services to small and marginal farmers. The frontend will be developed using Flutter or React Native for cross-platform accessibility, while the backend will utilize Python (Django/FastAPI) and Node.js, enabling scalable microservices architecture. To process data and drive intelligent decisions, the platform will integrate machine learning models developed in TensorFlow and Scikit-learn, while Natural Language Processing (NLP) support for regional languages will be enabled via IndicBERT, Hugging Face Transformers, and Google TTS. PostgreSQL with PostGIS will manage spatial data, and Firebase will support real-time updates. The system will fetch dynamic agro-climatic inputs through APIs from IMD, ISRO Bhuvan, and Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, enabling NDVI/EVI-based crop health analytics and real-time pest prediction models. The hardware stack will include Raspberry Pi 4 for rural kiosks, NPK and pH soil sensors, and optional multispectral drones (e.g., DJI Phantom) for remote crop surveillance. The implementation methodology follows a four-phase approach: (1) Data Acquisition, where soil, weather, and remote sensing inputs are gathered; (2) Model Training, where crop suitability and pest forecasting models are generated using Bayesian inference and fuzzy logic; (3) Advisory Delivery, via a multilingual mobile app, SMS, and IVR system to ensure inclusion for digitally illiterate users; and (4) Feedback Loop, where farmers’ input is used to retrain models for increased accuracy

## Feasibility and Viability
AgriSage is a feasible solution for modern farming as it leverages data-driven agriculture through IoT sensors, satellite inputs, soil testing, and weather forecasting, aligning with the global shift toward precision agriculture and smart farming. However, its implementation faces several challenges such as high initial costs that may limit adoption by small-scale farmers, poor internet connectivity in rural areas that can hinder real-time data transfer, data privacy concerns among farmers, reluctance to adopt new technologies, and the unpredictability of climate that may affect predictive accuracy. To overcome these challenges, AgriSage can provide affordable packages supported by subsidies or microfinancing, design offline-first features to ensure usability in low-connectivity areas, establish transparent data policies to build trust, conduct training and awareness programs to encourage adoption, and integrate adaptive AI models capable of handling unpredictable climate patterns, thereby ensuring its long-term sustainability and effectiveness in agriculture.

## Impact and Benefits
The potential impact of AgriSage on people is significant, as it empowers farmers with data-driven insights that help them make better decisions about crop planning, irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. This leads to higher productivity, reduced costs, and improved profitability, especially for small and medium-scale farmers. Beyond individual gains, the solution also provides broader benefits: socially, it enhances food security and improves the livelihoods of farming communities; economically, it increases efficiency, reduces wastage, and supports sustainable income generation; and environmentally, it promotes responsible use of resources like water, soil, and fertilizers, helping reduce the negative impacts of farming on ecosystems while encouraging sustainable agriculture practices.

## Research and References
Research from organizations like the FAO, World Bank, and IFPRI shows that digital farming solutions improve yields, cut resource use, and support smallholder farmers in adapting to climate change. Studies in agricultural journals highlight how IoT-based systems boost efficiency, while industry reports, such as those from McKinsey, emphasize the economic and sustainability benefits of AgriTech, reinforcing the value of platforms like AgriSage.
